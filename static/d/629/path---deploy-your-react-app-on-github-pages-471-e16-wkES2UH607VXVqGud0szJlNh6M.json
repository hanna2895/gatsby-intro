{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><em>February 15, 2019</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Github Pages only serves static files (html, css, js), which means that it doesn’t know what to do with all of the files created by create-react-app. However, that doesn’t mean you can’t deploy and show off your React app.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you get your React app up and running on Github Pages:</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong>. Create a Git repository if you don't already have one. You can check this by running <code>git status</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong>. Create a new branch, add and commit your changes, and then push it to Github:</p>\n<p><code>git checkout -b development</code></p>\n<p><code>git add .</code></p>\n<p><code>git commit -m 'created development branch</code></p>\n<p><code>git push origin development</code></p>\n<p>Github Pages deploys whatever is in your master branch, so we want to make sure that there are only static files present. We’ll do this by saving all the substance of your React app on the <em>development</em> branch, and re-creating the master branch so that it only contains static files.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong>. Navigate to your repository on Github, click on the Branches tab, and then click ‘Change Default Branch’. Set it to <em>development.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/gh-pages/1.png\" alt=\"Change default branch\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Deploy Your React App on Github Pages"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/deploy-your-react-app-on-github-pages/"}}
