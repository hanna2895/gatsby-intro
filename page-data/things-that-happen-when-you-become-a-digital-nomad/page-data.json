One year ago, I marched myself into my boss’s office and announced that I would be leaving at the end of the month to pursue something completely different, new, and terrifying with the hopes that it would allow me to achieve the life I wanted for myself. </p>\n<p>I’d spent my whole life jumping through the hoops - apply and get in to a ‘good’ college, study hard and get good grades, do all the internships to get ‘experience’, and then get a ‘good’ job and you’ll be happy. But I wasn’t. </p>\n<p>I set up the meeting for right after lunch so I could have the morning to prepare what I was going to say. I’d never really quit anything before, let alone take such a massive leap of faith and leave my whole life as I knew it behind. </p>\n<p>I didn’t really know what I was getting into. I’d read all the blogs about how to get started, how to make money online, where the best spots are for digital nomads to live, how to pack for long-term travel, and all that good stuff. I knew long-term travel would be a major adjustment. Looking back a year later, these are the things that I wish I knew to expect from my first year of digital nomad life: </p>\n<h2>1. When you first announce that you’re leaving, people will be generally supportive, but confused.</h2>\n<p><em>“You’re leaving to do what again, exactly?”</em></p>\n<p>Study web development, get freelance work, and work remotely from my laptop around the world until I get tired of traveling and find a place that I actually want to live.</p>\n<p><em>“When are you coming back?”</em></p>\n<p>I’m not. Probably for Christmas, but I’m not staying. </p>\n<p><em>“But where are you going to live?”</em></p>\n<p>Hostels, hotels, AirBnBs, co-living spaces, in a built-out camper van. I don’t know yet exactly. I have a one-way ticket and no plan, so I’ll just make it up as I go. </p>\n<p><em>“What are you going to do with the rest of your stuff?”</em></p>\n<p>What stuff? When I moved out, I sold everything I could and donated the rest. Apart from some miscellaneous winter clothes and childhood memorabilia that’s still cluttering up my parents’ house in Chicago, all of my belongings fit in a carry-on. This backpack is all of my stuff. </p>\n<p><em>“Oh, that’s cool. I wish I could travel like that, but I can’t because... I have kids / I like working in an office / I like knowing where I’m going to sleep every night / etc...”</em></p>\n<p>Cool. I’m not judging you. This lifestyle is definitely not for everyone. It’s a conscious choice that I made for my life and it took me nearly a year of planning, studying, hustling, saving, and scraping by to make it work. I value adventure and making the most of every day over stability and predictability. I wanted to work to live, rather than live to work, so I adjusted my skillset and my career to reflect that goal. Not everyone is willing or able to do that, and that’s okay. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/toledo.jpeg\" alt=\"toledo\"></p>\n<h2>2. People may never stop asking when you will stop traveling and get a ‘real’ job.</h2>\n<p>I don’t work 9-to-5, but I have a ‘real’ job. I still work ~40 hours a week while traveling (sometimes more, sometimes less). I run my own freelance web development business. It took me a while to get started, but I actually make the same amount of money, if not more than what I was making in my DC office job that I hated. </p>\n<p>Plus, I can do it from anywhere, I don’t have to wear business-professional or business-casual clothes (goodbye forever, flats and blazers). I don’t have to sit at a desk in a windowless room for 9 hours to work (hello, porch chair, pool deck, sunshine, rooftops, and mountain views). I make my own schedule, and no one refers to me as ‘the help’. </p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean that I don’t work hard. It just looks different than what most people would imagine a ‘real job’ to look like. Some days, it looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/gear.jpg\" alt=\"gear\"></p>\n<h2>3. Especially if you’re building your own online business instead of working for a company, your work and personal life begin to blur.</h2>\n<p>I love to code.\nI love to blog. </p>\n<p>I do both of those things for fun. I also make money doing both of those things. When you are your own boss, you have the freedom to work when and where you want, and it’s awesome. </p>\n<p>It’s also incredibly difficult. You have to set your own hours and stick to them. It’s easy to get wrapped up in an exciting project and watch your work-life balance go out the window. Especially as a developer and blogger, when I finish my client work, I can’t wait to start writing, working on a new side project, or learning new skills (hello React hooks and GraphQL!). But I also want to travel and experience each new place as much as possible, work on my relationships, exercise and nourish my body, and take time to relax and disconnect. </p>\n<p>Do I remember the last time I took a day off and didn’t touch a computer? Not really (although you can kinda tell by my Github contribution graph) It’s something I have to intentionally work at. It’s easier to do while traveling because there’s so much to explore, so for those weeks, I stack my 40 hours into four days and take three off to explore. If I’m traveling slower, I’ll spread my 40 hours into six or seven days so I can spend more time adventuring and spending time with people I love each day. But because I don’t have a schedule or set work times, it begins to blur. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/github-graph.png\" alt=\"github-graph\"></p>\n<h2>4. You will have to go out of your way to be social.</h2>\n<p>When you run your own business, work online, and live in a place where no one knows you, it’s so easy to go the whole day without talking to a single person. It’s for this reason that I prefer to stay in hostels - you’re constantly surrounded by people who also don’t know anyone there, so everyone is looking for new friends. </p>\n<p>However, because you move so often, and because other nomadic friends you meet along the way do the same, it’s harder to make long-term friendships. That doesn’t mean it’s not possible - I’ve made some incredible friends in my first six months of truly nomadic life. However, it does take some getting used to. </p>\n<p>I always joke that I’m a chronic airport crier, but it’s real. Flight attendants refer to this phenomenon as ‘jumpseat therapy’ - when you’re confined in a small space with a stranger for a fixed amount of time, you’re more likely to open up to them and be authentically yourself because after that interval is over, you never have to see each other again unless you want to. </p>\n<p>The same is true for travel friendships - you’re in a place where you don’t know anyone else and may not speak the language, but you both have an end date to your time there. So, you lay it all out on the table, forge a strong and unforgettable connection with that person or group of people, and then continue on your way after a few days. </p>\n<p>Part of adapting to long-term travel is learning how to thrive when everything in your life is transient. You have to either continue opening up to new people, or be alone. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/malaga.jpeg\" alt=\"malaga\"></p>\n<h2>5. Explaining where you’re from will never not be weird.</h2>\n<p>I’m from Chicago, but I don’t live there. </p>\n<p><em>Cool, then where do you live now?</em></p>\n<p>Here. Nowhere. Everywhere. I’ve been technically ‘homeless’ for a year now, in that I don’t have my own apartment or base. My official mailing and voter/tax registration address is at my parents’ house in Chicago because I need a fixed, US-based address, but that’s not where I live.</p>\n<p><em>How long are you traveling for?</em></p>\n<p>Indefinitely.\nMost people will be confused - it’s understandable. I’m just gonna tell you I’m from Chicago and leave it at that unless you pry further. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/city.jpeg\" alt=\"city\"></p>\n<h2>6. People love the ‘coolness’ of digital nomad life, but don’t always understand the challenges that come along with it.</h2>\n<p>Yes, I travel ten months out of the year. No, I am not on vacation. </p>\n<p>When you meet people in hostels, they’re on vacation, but you’re not, and they won’t always understand that. I’m not on vacation - this is just my life. While it seems cool in theory (and certainly looks cool on Instagram), digital nomad life is not easy. </p>\n<p>You have to move all. the. time. I move approximately every three-ish weeks when I’m traveling slow, but I’m usually taking weekend trips, so I have to pack up my life into a backpack every few days and get on a bus to somewhere new. It’s a relatively rare luxury for me to spend more than four nights in the same place. </p>\n<p>You don’t have the luxury of staying at home all day. One of the things that I miss the most about being home is having a kitchen and a pantry, or at least food delivery, so I have the option of staying inside on the couch all day. Before I started traveling full-time, if I spent more than a day or so without leaving the house, I’d get major cabin fever. But when I came home for the holidays to take a break from traveling and be in one place, I had zero problem with not leaving the house for days at a time, just because it hadn’t been an option for the past six months and I didn’t really have any reason to go outside into the awful Chicago winter weather.</p>\n<p>And honestly, when you’re working and traveling, a lot of time and energy goes into finding outlets and wifi, calculating time differences, and making a lot of Skype calls at really weird hours.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6-things/gibraltar2.jpeg\" alt=\"gibraltar2\"></p>\n<p>I thought I had an idea of what I was getting myself into a year ago when I walked into the boss’s office and announced that I was quitting. I knew it wouldn’t be easy. I’d traveled long-term before, but never more than two months at one time.</p>\n<p>I wasn’t prepared for how physically exhausting and emotionally draining life on the road can be. I wasn’t prepared to be beaten down by the pain of leaving friends back home. I wasn’t prepared for the bad luck of getting bedbugs, breaking two phones, and getting fired by a client within the span of two weeks in Lisbon. I wasn’t prepared to move to a new place at least every other day for three weeks between the end of November and when I arrived at home right before Christmas. </p>\n<p>One year later, knowing what I know now about the realities of digital nomad life, I would still do it again in a heartbeat, and I have no plans to stop any time soon.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading!
